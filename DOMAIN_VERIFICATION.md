# 🔐 DOMAIN VERIFICATION FOR EMAIL AUTOMATION

Your API key is set, but **one final step** is needed to send emails from `hello@tax-fix.org`.

## 🚨 **REQUIRED: Verify Domain in Resend**

### **Option 1: Quick Setup (Use Resend subdomain)**
**Fastest option - works immediately:**

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Instead of adding `tax-fix.org`, use Resend's subdomain
3. Emails will come from: `hello@resend.dev` or similar
4. **Works immediately** - no DNS changes needed

### **Option 2: Professional Setup (Use your domain)**
**Best for branding - requires DNS setup:**

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `tax-fix.org`
4. Add these DNS records to your domain:

```
TXT Record:
Name: _resend
Value: (Resend will provide this)

MX Record: 
Name: tax-fix.org
Value: (Resend will provide this)
```

5. Wait for verification (can take up to 24 hours)

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE TESTING:**

### **Test with Resend subdomain (works now):**
I can update the function to use a verified Resend subdomain for immediate testing.

### **Current status:**
- ✅ API key configured
- ✅ Function deployed  
- ✅ Admin email set
- ❌ Domain verification needed

## 🔧 **QUICK FIX - USE RESEND SUBDOMAIN:**

If you want emails working **immediately**, I can update the function to send from a Resend-verified subdomain instead of `hello@tax-fix.org`.

**Would you like me to:**
1. **Update to use Resend subdomain** (works immediately)
2. **Wait for you to verify tax-fix.org domain** (more professional)

## 🧪 **TEST THE SYSTEM:**

Once domain is verified (or we switch to subdomain):
1. Go to https://tax-fix.org/hiddenprofitfinder
2. Fill out form with your email
3. Check inbox for personalized email
4. Check hello@tax-fix.org for admin notification

## 📧 **EMAIL WILL INCLUDE:**

✅ Personalized savings estimate
✅ Business-specific deductions  
✅ State recommendations
✅ Structure advice
✅ Professional branding
✅ Consultation booking link

**Almost there! Just need domain verification to activate the complete system.** 🚀
