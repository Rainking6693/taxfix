alert('Success! You\'ve been subscribed...');

// Replace with ConvertKit example:
// Submit to ConvertKit API
fetch('https://api.convertkit.com/v3/forms/YOUR_FORM_ID/subscribe', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
        email: email,
        tags: ['blog-subscriber'],
        fields: {
            source: 'blog-post',

```

- Email 3: 4 days after signup

## Technical Implementation Details

### Form HTML Structure
All email capture forms should include these hidden fields for proper segmentation:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="source" value="blog-post">
<input type="hidden" name="interest" value="diy-tax-filing">
<input type="hidden" name="landing_page" value="current-page-url">
<input type="hidden" name="signup_date" value="current-timestamp">
```

### JavaScript Event Tracking
Ensure all form submissions trigger GA4 events:

```javascript
gtag('event', 'email_signup', {
    'event_category': 'conversion',
    'event_label': 'Blog Email Signup',
    'source': 'blog-post',
    'interest': 'diy-tax-filing',
    'value': 1
});
```

### A/B Testing Setup
Test these elements for optimization:
- Subject lines for each email in sequence
- CTA button text and colors
- Form placement and copy
- Email send times
- Frequency of follow-up emails

## Segmentation Strategy

### Primary Segments
1. **DIY Users** - Want to do taxes themselves
2. **Service Prospects** - May want professional help
3. **Tool Users** - Actively use calculators and tools
4. **Blog Readers** - Consume educational content

### Behavioral Triggers
Set up automations based on user behavior:
- Clicked Tax Fix Pack link → Send product-focused emails
- Used Hidden Profit Finder → Send advanced deduction tips
- Visited professional help page → Send consultation offers
- Downloaded free guides → Send related educational content

## Deliverability Best Practices

- DKIM signing
- DMARC policy
- Custom tracking domain

### List Hygiene

```
