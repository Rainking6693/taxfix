                <p>Most gig workers only track active ride/delivery miles, but you can also deduct:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Miles driving TO your first pickup</li>
                    <li>Miles between ride requests while your app is on</li>
                    <li>Miles driving home from your last delivery</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This simple change typically adds $300-800 to your annual deductions!</p>

            <h2 style="margin: 0; color: white;">5 Costly Tax Mistakes (Avoid These!) ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [FIRST_NAME],</p>
            
            <p>Yesterday I shared how tracking "dead miles" could save you hundreds. Today, I want to protect you from the <strong>5 most expensive tax mistakes</strong> I see gig workers make every tax season.</p>
            
            <p>Each of these mistakes could cost you $200-1,000+ in extra taxes:</p>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Mistake #1: Only tracking "active" miles</h3>
            <p>Many drivers only log miles during active rides/deliveries. You can deduct ALL business miles while your app is available for requests.</p>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Mistake #2: Not deducting phone expenses</h3>
            <p>Your phone is essential for gig work! Deduct the business percentage of your monthly bill, data plan, and business-related accessories.</p>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Mistake #3: Missing the home office deduction</h3>
            <p>Even if it's just a corner of your bedroom where you handle gig work admin, you may qualify for up to $1,500 in home office deductions.</p>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Mistake #4: Forgetting quarterly estimated taxes</h3>
            <p>If you owe $1,000+ at tax time, the IRS expects quarterly payments. Miss these and face penalties.</p>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Mistake #5: Not keeping receipts</h3>
            <p>No receipt = no deduction in an audit. Use apps like Stride or Shoeboxed to photograph receipts instantly.</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>üí° Quick Action Step:</h3>
                <p>Pick ONE of these mistakes you might be making and fix it this week. Small actions lead to big tax savings!</p>

            <h2 style="margin: 0; color: white;">How Sarah Found $1,200 in Hidden Deductions üí∞</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Hi [FIRST_NAME],</p>
            
            <p>I promised you a real case study today, so let me introduce you to Sarah M., an Uber driver from Chicago.</p>
            
            <p>Sarah was doing everything "right" ‚Äì tracking her rides, saving gas receipts, even using a mileage app. But when she used our Hidden Profit Finder, we discovered she was missing <strong>$1,243 in legitimate deductions.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Here's what Sarah was missing:</h3>
            
            <p><strong>üí∏ $487 in phone expenses</strong><br>
            Sarah was only deducting her "business" phone calls. We showed her how to calculate the business percentage of her entire phone bill (including data) based on work hours.</p>
            
            <p><strong>üí∏ $312 in car maintenance</strong><br>
            She was saving receipts but not calculating the business percentage. Since she drove 70% for business, 70% of ALL car expenses are deductible.</p>
            
            <p><strong>üí∏ $289 in home office deduction</strong><br>
            Sarah used a corner of her bedroom for Uber admin (tracking earnings, printing tax documents). This 64-square-foot space qualified for the home office deduction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>üí∏ $155 in forgotten expenses</strong><br>
            Car air fresheners, seat covers, snacks for passengers, phone accessories ‚Äì small expenses that add up!</p>
            
            <div class="tip-box">
                <h3>üéØ Sarah's Results:</h3>
                <p>"I thought I knew all the deductions. Finding an extra $1,200 was like getting a bonus check! The tool paid for itself in the first month." - Sarah M.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The best part? These aren't "one-time" savings. Sarah will save this amount <em>every year</em> now that she knows what to track.</p>
