            <h3>Calculating Quarterly Payments</h3>

            <p>Use the "safe harbor" rule to avoid penalties:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pay 100% of last year's tax liability</strong> (110% if prior year AGI exceeded $150,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Or pay 90% of current year's projected tax</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Quarterly Payment Example:</h4>
                <p><strong>Driver Profile:</strong> $60,000 annual Uber income, $18,000 in deductions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Net business income: $42,000</li>
                    <li>Self-employment tax: $5,940 (14.13% of net income)</li>
                    <li>Income tax (22% bracket): $8,547</li>
                    <li>Total annual tax: $14,487</li>
                    <li><strong>Quarterly payment: $3,622</strong></li>

            <h2>Common Mistakes That Cost Drivers Thousands</h2>

            <h3>1. Starting Mileage Tracking Too Late</h3>

            <p>You cannot recreate mileage logs retroactively for IRS purposes. Many drivers lose their first year's mileage deduction entirely.</p>

            <h3>2. Mixing Business and Personal Expenses</h3>

            <p>Using one credit card for everything makes separating business expenses nearly impossible during an audit.</p>

            <h3>3. Not Understanding Business Use Percentage</h3>

            <p>Many drivers assume they can deduct 100% of vehicle expenses, but you can only deduct the percentage used for business.</p>

            <h3>4. Ignoring Self-Employment Tax</h3>

            <p>The 15.3% self-employment tax is in addition to regular income tax and catches many new drivers off-guard.</p>

            <h3>5. Poor Receipt Organization</h3>

            <p>Keeping receipts in a shoebox isn't sufficient. The IRS requires organized, readable records with clear business purposes.</p>

            <h3>6. Missing Estimated Tax Payments</h3>

            <p>Quarterly payments are required if you owe $1,000+ in taxes. Missing payments triggers automatic penalties and interest.</p>
