                        <h2>Why Most Freelancers Miss Critical Tax Deductions</h2>
                        
                        <p>The average freelancer overpays their taxes by <strong>$3,200 annually</strong> simply by missing legitimate business deductions. Unlike W-2 employees who get standard deductions, freelancers and 1099 contractors can deduct virtually any ordinary and necessary business expense.</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <h3>💡 Key Stat</h3>
                            <p>IRS data shows that self-employed individuals who properly track and claim business deductions save an average of <strong>$3,200-$8,400 per year</strong> compared to those who don't.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>The problem isn't lack of eligible deductions—it's <strong>poor tracking and unawareness</strong> of what qualifies as a business expense. This comprehensive freelancer tax deduction tracker will ensure you never miss a write-off again.</p>
